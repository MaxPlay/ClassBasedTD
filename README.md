# Class Based Tower Defense

CBTD (or how you want to call it) is the working title of an open source (local) multiplayer tower defense game that was originally made in C# and XNA as a group assignment in my university by a few students and myself.

## Getting Started

This game is written in C++ and may be downloaded and played by anyone, but note that it is in active development and may not work as expected. To compile the game, check the prerequisites first!

### Prerequisites

This game is written in C++17 and uses the SFML binaries provided [here](https://github.com/SFML/SFML/releases/tag/2.5.0). Because of these binaries (and my preferences), the game needs to be compiled by Visual C++17.

### Installing

Checkout the releases and download the newest version that is available.
